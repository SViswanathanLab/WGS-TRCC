# Annotation of gene alteration by copy-number
These scripts have been modified from Zhou et al. 2022, available here [https://github.com/GavinHaLab/crpc-sv-pattern-study]

## How to run

### For gene annotation



### For histogram plot

1. Run runTitanMatrix.sh - This step is similar to runFreq.sh (This takes 100kb_geneMats.RData from step 1)
2. Run runFreq.sh (This takes 100kb_geneMats.RData from step 1)
