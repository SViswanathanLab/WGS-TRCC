Gene_Map_Break.Rmd
	This file plots genes with representative features for untranslated regions, introns, exons, and breakpoint markers.

Input files:
	BED files from the UCSC genome browser containing information about gene features (size and position of introns, exons, utrs)
	Breakpoint locations (DNA from SVABA, RNA from STAR fusion)

Output:
	PDF or SVG files of gene feature plots with RNA and DNA breakpoints marked, if applicable
