Fig 2D and F Breakpoint Fusion.ipynb
	This file generates a scatterplot of the breakpoint loss and gain as well as the TFE3 and partner loss and gain, as well as a barplot of the frequency of different values of nucleotide loss and gain in the sample cohort.

Input file:
	Fusion_breakpoint_coordiantes.csv (columns in the file: DNA loss/gain for TFE3, DNA loss/gain for partner gene, breakpoint loss/gain at TFE3. Breakpoint loss/gain at partner gene)
	
Output:
	PDF files of plots:
	heatmap.pdf 
	barplot.pdf
