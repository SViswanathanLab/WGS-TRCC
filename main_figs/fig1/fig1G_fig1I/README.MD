Breakpoint Fusion Figure.ipynb generates a scatterplot of the breakpoint loss and gain as well as the TFE3 and partner loss and gain, as well as a barplot of the frequency of different values of nucleotide loss and gain in the sample cohort.

Fusion_breakpoint_coordiantes.csv is the input file, curated from TFE3-fusion-table (columns in the file: DNA loss/gain for TFE3, DNA loss/gain for partner gene, breakpoint loss/gain at TFE3, breakpoint loss/gain at partner gene)
