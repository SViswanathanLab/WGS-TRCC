### Supplemental Information 1 and 2

Circos and allelic distribution plots for misclassified tRCC sample RCC16 and all the other remaining tRCCs from 15 patients were generated using the data provided as tRCC alleles for Fig S2.

Boxplots of sSNVs and INDELs in RCC16 (Supplementary Information 1) were generated using data from Table S2 with R ggplot package.
