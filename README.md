## Whole genome sequence analyses of translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC)

This repository contains codes used in the manuscript "_A genetic basis for cancer sex differences revealed in Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma_" https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.04.552029v1 to analyze 29 tRCC samples (in-house datasets) from 15 patients and 145 published tRCC whole-exome sequences.

The published data used in this study are from-
